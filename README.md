### Project Description:

<p align="justify">
For our project, we were given four different prompts, one of which was to create a 3 part video series that teaches us "How To..." do something. We initially decided to follow this prompt but later came up with an idea to use this as the base and mix it with the first prompt, which was to tell a story about a specific location and the characters who visit or live there. Our initial idea was to create a how to do your skincare routine video series with an unexpected twist. We later realized that this idea fits the first prompt better where we present our idea as a story about the haunted residence of an influencer, who is trying to make a video about her skincare and makeup routine. We then convey the horror experience that our protagonist, who lives in the haunted residence, encounters as she is shooting her "How to do your skincare/makeup" video. We decided to present the video as a special live video on the Vogue website as our idea matched well with the kind of videos Vogue website hosts.

### Process:

For the video, we took multiple shots of the various scenes and later merged them using DaVinci resolve. We edited the video to make it look like a single continuous video and added effects where we thought they were necessary. Most of the background sounds were kept from the raw footage as they were good enough for the video. We also added some sounds from the Internet, the ones that we were unable to capture properly ourselves. We added the glitching effect between the multiple clips/shots to make the transition smoother. We also added more effects to make the video look more real.

For the website, multiple of us worked to make the final product. Different people worked on different pages of the website and later merged them as one whole. Fllowing our decision to present the video as a special live video on Vogue website, we made our website look as much as possible like the original Vogue website. We used fonts and layouts that matched with the Vogue website. Video page was the main page where our video resided. However, we added more pages (News, Subscribe and Home) just to make the website look more like the actual Vogue website.

For the interactive element in the website, we decided to integrate the interactivity with the video itself. Since the video was shot as a live video, we added a live comments section where comments appear as the video progresses. This was done using Javascript and CSS, by using the currentTime attribute of the &ltvideo&gt tag to control when the elements containing the comments appear on the screen. We also added a feature where the user of the website can add their own comment to the comments section. This made the website even more interactive for the user. One other interactive element that we added to our website is when the user is asked a question based on the question of the protagonist in the video. The video is paused, the user is prompted to respond, and the video continues once the user responds (a comment in also added in the comments sections based on the user's response). As the video progresses and the horror part starts, the website also changes to give a more spooky vibe.

### Reflection/Evaluation:
<p align="justify">
We were able to make the website exactly like we had planned. One of the issues we ran into was the size of the video file. We used the HTML &ltvideo&gt tag to integrate the video to our website but could not upload the video to GitHub because it was of huge size and therefore, we had to compress the video and compromise its quality to be able to upload it successfully and make our website work. Something we can do in the future is to work with iframes and integrate the videos from YouTube from the beginning to avoid any size issues.
